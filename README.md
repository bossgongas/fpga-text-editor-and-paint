# üñ•Ô∏è FPGA-Based Text & Graphics Editors

This repository contains two digital systems developed in VHDL and deployed on an FPGA board (Altera DE2):  
a **Text Editor** and a **Graphics Editor**, both rendered on a VGA display and controlled via keyboard or mouse.

## üß† Text Editor Overview

The text editor emulates a terminal with basic line editing, enabling:

- Character input via PS/2 keyboard
- Handling of ENTER, BACKSPACE and arrow keys
- VGA rendering of characters using a CHAR ROM
- Cursor movement and screen updates via RAM and sync control

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Modules
- `KeyboardController.vhd`: Scancode parsing
- `CharDecoder.vhd`: PS2 to CHAR ROM address conversion
- `CursorControl.vhd`: Position tracking and cursor behavior
- `RAM.vhd`: Stores character grid for VGA output
- `TopLevel.vhd`: Integrates all modules

---

## üé® Graphics Editor Overview

This system allows freehand drawing using a PS/2 mouse on VGA display, supporting:

- A visible 4x4 pixel cursor
- Drawing and erasing with mouse buttons
- Selection between 8 different colors
- Full-screen clearing via hardware button

### üõ†Ô∏è Key Modules
- `PaintControl.vhd`: Color & draw logic from switches/buttons
- `Cursor.vhd`: Determines cursor location and pixel rendering
- `MouseInterface.vhd`: Interfaces with PS/2 mouse input
- `RAM.vhd`: Stores pixel color values for drawing
- `TopLevel.vhd`: High-level schematic

## üñºÔ∏è System Diagrams

Each project includes a top-level view image in its respective folder (from the report), showing module interconnections and data flow.

---

## üé• Demos

Demo videos demonstrating editor functionality are available in the `/media` folder:
- `demo_text.mp4`: Text input, backspace, enter and cursor movements
- `demo_graphics.mp4`: Freehand drawing and color switching

---

## üìå Notes

- All VHDL code was synthesized and tested using **Quartus II**
- RAM modules created using Altera Megafunctions (`lpm_ram_dp`)
- Interfaces strictly use VGA + PS/2 protocols
- This project was part of the final lab assignment for PSD (Projeto de Sistemas Digitais)
